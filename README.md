# <p align="center">Netflix Data Analysis</p>
## Overview:
Analyzed Netflix data using SQL and Python, and visualized the cleaned dataset with Tableau to extract insights and identify trends.

## Data Cleaning: 
I obtained the raw Netflix dataset from Kaggle, available [here](Netflix_Raw_Data.csv)

This dataset includes listings of all movies and TV shows on Netflix, along with details like cast, directors, ratings, release year, and duration.

To clean the data, I utilized both Python and SQL. You can find the cleaned dataset [here](Netflix_Data_Cleaned.csv)

## Insights from SQL:
After cleaning the data in SQL, I analyzed several key insights:

**Director Output**: Counted the number of movies and TV shows for each director in separate columns.
**Comedy Movies by Country**: Identified the countries with the highest number of comedy movies.
**Top Directors by Year**: Determined which director released the most movies for each year, based on the date_added.
**Average Movie Duration**: Calculated the average duration of movies within each genre.
**Directors of Multiple Genres**: Listed directors who have created both horror and comedy movies, along with the count of comedy and horror films they've directed.
