# Netflix Data Analysis

Overview:
Data Analysis of Netflix using both SQL and Python along with a visualization of the cleaned dataset using Tableau to gather insights and trends in the data.

Data Cleaning: 
I took the raw Netflix dataset from Kaggle which can be found here: [Click Here](Netflix_Raw_Data.csv)

The dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

I used both Python and SQL to clean the data. The cleaned dataset can be found here: [Click Here](Netflix_Data_Cleaned.csv)

Insights from SQL:
After doing a data clean up in SQL, I analyzed some key insights related to the data such as:
1. For each director, count the number of movies and tv shows created by them in seperate columns.
2. Which countries have highest number of comedy movies?
3. Which director has maximum number of movies released for each year (based on date_added)?
4. What is the average duration of movies in each genre?
5. List of directors who have created both horror and comedy movies. Display director name along with number of comedy and horror movies directed by them.

The SQL code can be found here: [Click Here](https://github.com/Habzal/Netflix-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Netflix%20Data%20Analysis.sql)

Here is a link to my Tableau dashboard which provides us key insights and trends on our cleaned Netflix data:
